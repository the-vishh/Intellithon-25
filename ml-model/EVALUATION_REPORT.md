## 🎯 Confusion Matrix

### All Models (Perfect Classification)

```
              Predicted
              Phishing  Legitimate
Actual
Phishing         100         0
Legitimate         0       100
```

**Interpretation:**

- ✅ **True Positives:** 100 (phishing correctly identified)
- ✅ **True Negatives:** 100 (legitimate correctly identified)
- ✅ **False Positives:** 0 (no legitimate sites flagged as phishing)
- ✅ **False Negatives:** 0 (no phishing sites missed)
