## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Why Current Models Fail

1. ❌ Trained on synthetic/random features
2. ❌ Never saw real phishing patterns
3. ❌ Feature extraction errors not handled
4. ❌ No validation on real URLs

### Recommended Approach

1. ✅ Use pre-trained models (HuggingFace)
2. ✅ OR train on simplified feature set (25 features vs 159)
3. ✅ Implement robust error handling
4. ✅ Start with heuristic rules, enhance with ML

### Architecture Strengths

1. ✅ Solid infrastructure (Rust + Python + Redis)
2. ✅ Scalable design
3. ✅ Proper separation of concerns
4. ✅ Caching layer

### Architecture Weaknesses

1. ⚠️ Over-complicated feature extraction
2. ⚠️ No fallback for feature failures
3. ⚠️ Models never validated on real data
4. ⚠️ No gradual rollout strategy
