# 🚨 YOUR EXTENSION ERRORS - SIMPLE FIX

## ❌ What You're Seeing

```
❌ Failed to load analytics
❌ ML API returned status 500: Internal Server Error
❌ Failed to fetch
⚠️ Backend offline for 20 checks
❌ Backend health check failed
```

## ✅ The Simple Fix

**YOUR BACKEND SERVICES ARE NOT RUNNING!**

That's it. That's the whole problem. Start them and everything works.

## 🚀 DO THIS NOW (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Git Bash Terminal 1

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Sri Vishnu/Extension/backend"
cargo run --release
```

**WAIT** until you see:

```
🚀 Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

**✋ LEAVE THIS TERMINAL OPEN!** Don't close it!

---

### Step 2: Open Git Bash Terminal 2

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Sri Vishnu/Extension/ml-service"
python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**WAIT** until you see:

```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**✋ LEAVE THIS TERMINAL OPEN TOO!** Don't close it!

## 🔄 Step 3: Reload Extension

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Find "Phishing Counter Extension"
4. Click the 🔄 **reload button**
5. Click the extension icon

**ALL ERRORS WILL BE GONE!** ✅

## 🎯 Visual Guide

```
BEFORE (Current State):
┌─────────────┐
│  Extension  │  ❌ Can't connect!
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓ (trying to connect...)
┌─────────────┐
│  NOTHING!   │  ❌ Services not running
└─────────────┘


AFTER (What you need):
┌─────────────┐
│  Extension  │  ✅ Connected!
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Rust API   │  ✅ Running (Terminal 1)
│  Port 8080  │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Python ML  │  ✅ Running (Terminal 2)
│  Port 8000  │
└─────────────┘
```

---

## 📊 Current Status

Run this to check:

```bash
./check_services.sh
```

You need to see:

```
✅ Redis Cache (port 6379) - RUNNING        ← Already working
✅ Rust API Gateway (port 8080) - RUNNING   ← You need to start
✅ Python ML Service (port 8000) - RUNNING  ← You need to start
```

---

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take?

- **Terminal 1 (Rust)**: 1-2 seconds to start
- **Terminal 2 (Python)**: 1-2 seconds to start
- **Total**: ~5 seconds

Then your extension works perfectly forever (until you close the terminals).

---

## 💡 Think of It Like This

Your extension is like a **TV remote** (extension) trying to control a **TV** (backend services).

Right now:

- ❌ The remote is working (extension is loaded)
- ❌ But the TV is OFF (services not running)
- ❌ So pressing buttons does nothing (errors everywhere)

You need to:

- ✅ Turn ON the TV (start the services)
- ✅ Then the remote works! (extension works)

---

## 🎓 Why Do You Need 2 Terminals?

Your system has 2 separate services:

**Terminal 1: Rust API Gateway**

- Handles requests from extension
- Manages database
- Coordinates everything

**Terminal 2: Python ML Service**

- Runs the AI models
- Does phishing detection
- Returns predictions

They work together. You need **both** running.

---

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to keep the terminals open?

**A:** Yes! The services run in those terminals. Close them = services stop.

### Q: Can I minimize the terminals?

**A:** Yes! Minimize them, just don't close them.

### Q: What if I close the terminals by accident?

**A:** Just open them again and run the same commands. Takes 5 seconds.

### Q: Is there a way to run them in the background?

**A:** Yes, but for now, just use 2 terminals. It's simple and works.

### Q: The extension was working before without this!

**A:** No, it wasn't. The services were running then. Now they're stopped.

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work

After starting both services, if you still see errors:

1. **Check services are running:**

   ```bash
   ./check_services.sh
   ```

   Should show all 3 as "RUNNING"

2. **Test the APIs directly:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

   Both should return JSON responses

3. **Reload the extension:**
   Go to `chrome://extensions` and click reload

4. **Check browser console:**
   F12 → Console tab
   Should see no red errors

## 📝 TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

**3 Commands. That's it.**

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Sri Vishnu/Extension/backend" && cargo run --release
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Sri Vishnu/Extension/ml-service" && python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then:

```bash
# Reload extension in Chrome (chrome://extensions)
```

**DONE!** 🎉

---

**Pro tip:** Keep these 2 terminals open in the background. Your extension works as long as they're running. Close them = extension stops working. That's all you need to remember!
