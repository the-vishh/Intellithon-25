# ✅ READY TO LOAD - ROOT FOLDER FIXED!

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved!**

You were trying to load the wrong folder. The GitHub version uses the **ROOT folder**, not the subfolder.

---

## 📂 **CORRECT Folder to Load:**

```
C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension
```

This is the **ROOT folder** that matches your GitHub version at:
https://github.com/the-vishh/Intellithon-25/blob/main/manifest.json

---

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. ✅ **Added icon files** to ROOT folder:

   - `icon16.svg` (433 bytes) ✅
   - `icon48.svg` (775 bytes) ✅
   - `icon128.svg` (1,212 bytes) ✅

2. ✅ **Updated ROOT manifest.json** with icon declarations

3. ✅ **All files verified** present and correct

---

## 🚀 **Load Extension NOW:**

### Quick Steps:

1. Open: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable: **Developer mode** (top-right)
3. Click: **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select: `C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension` (**ROOT folder**)
5. Click: **"Select Folder"**

### What You'll See:

- ✅ Extension name: **"Phishing Counter Extension"**
- ✅ Version: **1.0**
- ✅ Blue shield icon 🛡️
- ✅ No errors

## 📊 **Folder Comparison:**

| Path                                       | What It Is                                   | Load This?                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension\`           | **Main extension** (GitHub version)          | ✅ **YES - Load this!**   |
| `C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension\extension\` | Alternative version with real-time detection | ❌ No (different version) |

---

## 🎯 **Why This Confused You:**

In **VSCode**, you see both folders in the tree:

```
Extension/              ← This is what you load in Chrome!
├── extension/          ← This is a different version
│   └── manifest.json   (Real-time detection version)
├── manifest.json       ← This is the GitHub version
├── popup.html
├── app.js
└── ...
```

When you clicked "Load unpacked", you may have accidentally selected the **extension subfolder** instead of the **Extension root folder**.

---

## ✅ **Verification Checklist:**

After loading, verify:

- [ ] Extension appears with name "Phishing Counter Extension"
- [ ] Blue shield icon 🛡️ visible
- [ ] Version shows "1.0"
- [ ] No red error messages
- [ ] Click icon → popup opens
- [ ] Click "View Dashboard" → opens dashboard

1. The Chrome extensions page showing your extension
