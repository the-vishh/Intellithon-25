User: Can proceed with caution
```

#### Balanced Mode:

```
Action: WARN
Reason: Multiple suspicious indicators
User: Strong warning, can proceed
```

#### Aggressive Mode:

```
Action: BLOCK
Reason: Suspicious patterns detected
User: Cannot proceed (must go back)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading?

- ✅ Ensure Developer mode is enabled
- ✅ Check folder path is correct
- ✅ Verify `manifest.json` exists
- ✅ Reload extension: Click refresh icon

### Not Detecting Threats?

- ✅ Check detection mode (might be too conservative)
- ✅ Verify extension is enabled
- ✅ Check browser console for errors (F12)
- ✅ Try aggressive mode for testing

### Warning Page Not Showing?

- ✅ Verify `warning.html` exists in extension folder
- ✅ Check chrome://extensions/ for errors
- ✅ Reload extension

### Slow Performance?

- ✅ Connect ML backend for faster caching
- ✅ Check network connection (threat intelligence)
- ✅ Reduce sensitivity mode if too aggressive

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### What Data is Collected?

- ✅ URLs scanned (stored locally only)
- ✅ Threat statistics (local only)
- ✅ Detection patterns (for improvement)
