# 🎯 QUICK FIX - CHROME FOLDER PICKER

## The Issue:
Chrome's "Load unpacked" dialog **ONLY shows folders**, not files. This is normal!

## The Solution:

### Step 1: Navigate to Parent Folder
In Chrome's picker, go to:
```
C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\
```

### Step 2: You'll See This:
```
📁 Extension          ← Click this ONCE to highlight it
📁 Desktop
📁 Documents
📁 Downloads
(other folders...)
```

### Step 3: Click "Select Folder"
Don't double-click! Just click once to highlight, then click "Select Folder" button.

## ❌ What NOT to Do:
```
DON'T go here: C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension\
DON'T look for: manifest.json (Chrome hides files)
DON'T double-click: Just single-click to select
```

## ✅ What TO Do:
```
GO here: C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\
SEE: Extension folder
DO: Click Extension once → Click "Select Folder" button
```

## 🚀 Alternative (Easier Way):

1. In Chrome's picker address bar, **type or paste**:
   ```
   C:\Users\Sri Vishnu\Extension
   ```

2. Press **Enter**

3. Click **"Select Folder"** button

Done! ✅

**Remember**: Chrome hides files in the picker. You're selecting the FOLDER that contains manifest.json, not the manifest.json file itself!
